# Blinkist Subscription Guide (2025): Is It Worth The Money?
Ever feel like there’s never enough time to read all the books you want? Yeah—same here.

That’s why I gave [Blinkist](https://blinkist-us.pxf.io/zx5rkO) a shot. With quick, 15-minute summaries of top nonfiction books, it felt like finally hacking the reading list I’d been drowning in.

But before I signed up, I had so many questions: Is the Blinkist app free or paid? How much does Blinkist cost? Is there a free trial—or even a free plan? I went down the rabbit hole so you don’t have to.

This no-fluff guide breaks down exactly what a Blinkist subscription includes, how the free trial works, and whether it’s worth the monthly or yearly cost.

Let’s get you the answers—and maybe even save you a few bucks.

## What Is Blinkist — Free vs Paid
[<img width="674" height="503" alt="blinkist img" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ca92cbb-a0e1-4c08-a152-ea532a927777" />](https://blinkist-us.pxf.io/zx5rkO)

[Blinkist](https://blinkist-us.pxf.io/zx5rkO) is a book summary app built for people who want to learn fast without spending hours reading full books.

Instead of full chapters, it gives you “Blinks” — short, bite-sized summaries you can read or listen to in about 15 minutes.

Now, let’s clear up one of the biggest questions:

**Is the Blinkist app free or paid?** Both.

Blinkist does offer a [free version](https://blinkist-us.pxf.io/zx5rkO), but it’s super limited.

With the free plan, you only get access to one pre-selected Blink per day.

You can’t choose the title, and there’s no offline mode or full library access.

If you want to pick any book you want, highlight key ideas, listen offline, or use advanced features like Shortcasts or the Blinkist AI Assistant, you’ll need a paid [Blinkist subscription](https://blinkist-us.pxf.io/zx5rkO).

**So, is there a free plan for Blinkist?**  
Yes, but think of it more like a “daily teaser” than a true free membership. It’s a great way to test the format, but not enough to truly dive in.

To get the most out of Blinkist, you’ll need to upgrade to either their [monthly](https://blinkist-us.pxf.io/zx5rkO) or [yearly plan](https://blinkist-us.pxf.io/zx5rkO), which we’ll break down in detail in the next sections.

Here’s some good news: Blinkist offers a free trial so you can try out the full app without paying a cent upfront.

**How long is the Blinkist free trial?**  
You get 7 days of full access to the [premium version of Blinkist](https://blinkist-us.pxf.io/zx5rkO).

That means you can read or listen to unlimited Blinks, save highlights, use audio mode offline, and even try out the new AI features (if available in your region).

**What’s included in the Blinkist free trial?**  
Everything. It’s not watered down. You can explore thousands of bestselling nonfiction titles, test out Shortcasts, and see if the app fits your routine.

A few things to note:  
You will need to enter your payment info (credit card or Apple/Google Pay) to activate the free trial.

If you don’t cancel before the 7 days are up, you’ll be charged automatically for either the monthly or yearly subscription, depending on what you chose.

You can cancel anytime during the trial to avoid charges.

If you’re unsure whether to go monthly or yearly, don’t worry — we’ll cover Blinkist pricing in the next section so you can decide what makes sense for your budget.
